## [Unreleased]

First release. Vim for VS Code over IdeaVim's `vim-engine`, compiled to JavaScript.

- Normal, insert, visual, visual block, select, replace and operator-pending modes, with counts,
  registers, macros, marks, jumps, the change list, text objects, `.`, undo and redo.
- Search with `'incsearch'` and `'hlsearch'`, `:substitute` and its flags, `:global`, `:normal`,
  `:sort`, `:uniq`.
- Around 380 ex commands and 170 Vimscript builtin functions.
- More than a hundred options, read from the first config found of `~/.vimperorrc`, `~/.ideavimrc`
  and `~/.vimrc` - so an existing Vim or IdeaVim setup needs nothing copied or renamed. XDG
  locations included.
- `<Action>(id)` and `:action` to run any VS Code command; `:actionlist` to find one, with the
  keyboard shortcut it already has.
- `:sign`, `:highlight`, `:match`, `:redir`, `:messages` and the quickfix and location lists.
- The first of IdeaVim's bundled extensions: `ReplaceWithRegister` (`gr`, `grr`),
  `vim-paragraph-motion` (`{` and `}` stopping at whitespace-only lines) and `textobj-entire`
  (`ae`, `ie`), each enabled with the `Plug` line you would use in IdeaVim.
